''' send_input for python 3, from jh45dev@gmail.com

code from Daniel F is adapted here. The original is at:
http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-win32/2005-April/003131.html


SendInput sends to the window that has the keyboard focus.
That window must not be minimized.


There seem to be some strange limitations with user32.SendInput()
Here is what happened in my testing (on Vista sp2).

 [edit: It is OK if I work from a folder within my profile.
 These problems happened when working on another partition.
 File permissions were OK, so do not know what blocked SendInput.]

1
I opened Notepad from the Start menu,
then in Notepad opened test.txt,
and all worked fine.

2
I opened Notepad by opening test.txt in Explorer.
find_window() found Notepad, but user32.SendInput() had no effect.
If Notepad was minimized, it did not get restored or focussed.

The same happened with SciTE and Notepad2.


Another strangeness:
For SciTE I had to put in the whole window title, eg "test.txt - SciTE",
but for Notepad and Notepad2, only the app name, eg "Notepad".
